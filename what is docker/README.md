## What is a container ?


A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. 

Containers allow applications to be packaged and run in isolation from other software running on the same machine.

#### Containers are often used in software development and operations for several reasons:

Isolation: Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring it runs the same way regardless of where it's deployed.

Portability: Since containers bundle the application and its environment, they can run consistently across different environments (e.g., development, testing, and production).

Efficiency: Containers share the host system's operating system kernel, which makes them more lightweight compared to virtual machines (VMs), which include a full OS image.

Scalability: Containers can be spun up and torn down quickly, making them ideal for scaling applications in cloud environments.

Popular containerization tools include Docker, which is the most widely used, and Kubernetes, which is used for orchestrating and managing large numbers of containers across many machines.
